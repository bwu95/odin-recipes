        Meatball spaghetti is a classic dish that has been enjoyed for generations. 
        To make this comforting and flavorful meal, you will need to start by making 
        your meatballs. Combine ground beef, breadcrumbs, grated Parmesan cheese, finely 
        chopped onion, minced garlic, an egg, and some salt and pepper in a large mixing bowl. 
        Use your hands to mix the ingredients together and form small meatballs. Next, cook your 
        spaghetti according to the package instructions and set it aside. In a large saucepan, 
        heat some olive oil and sauté some chopped onion and garlic until they are soft and fragrant. 
        Add a can of crushed tomatoes, some dried basil and oregano, and some salt and pepper. Let 
        the sauce simmer for a few minutes before adding the meatballs. Cover the pan and let the 
        meatballs cook in the sauce for about 15-20 minutes, or until they are cooked through. Serve 
        the meatballs and sauce over the cooked spaghetti and garnish with fresh parsley and grated 
        Parmesan cheese. This dish is sure to be a hit with your family or guests, and it's perfect 
        for a cozy weeknight dinner or a special occasion.
