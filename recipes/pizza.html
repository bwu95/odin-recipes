    <h3>A scrumptious pizza recipe</h3>
    <p>
        Pizza is a beloved dish that originated in Italy but has become a global favorite. 
        To make a classic pizza, you'll need to start by making or purchasing pizza dough, 
        which can be made from scratch using flour, yeast, salt, and water. Then, you can 
        spread a layer of tomato sauce over the dough and sprinkle on shredded mozzarella 
        cheese. After that, you can add toppings of your choice, such as pepperoni, mushrooms, 
        onions, or olives. Finally, you'll bake the pizza in a preheated oven at around 425°F 
        (218°C) for approximately 12-15 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the 
        cheese is melted and bubbly. Once it's done, you can slice the pizza and serve it hot 
        and fresh for a delicious meal that everyone will love.
