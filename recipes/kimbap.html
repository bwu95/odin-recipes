    <h3>Tasty Kimbap Recipe</h3>
    <p>
        Kimbap is a popular Korean dish that consists of steamed white rice, various vegetables, meat (optional), and sometimes egg, all rolled up in sheets of dried seaweed. This dish is similar to sushi rolls, but with a Korean twist. Kimbap is often prepared as a convenient and filling snack or meal, and is also a popular food for picnics or outdoor events. To make kimbap, the ingredients are prepared and laid out on top of the seaweed sheet, then rolled up tightly using a bamboo mat. Once rolled, the kimbap is sliced into bite-sized pieces and served with a dipping sauce. Kimbap can be customized with different ingredients to suit personal taste preferences, and is a delicious and nutritious dish that is enjoyed by many around the world.

        <li>4 cups (800g) cooked white rice</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon (15ml) rice vinegar</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon (15ml) sugar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon (5ml) salt</li>
        <li>8-10 oz (225-280g) protein of choice (e.g. ham, bulgogi, crab meat, tofu)
        </li>
        <li>1 medium carrot, julienned</li>
        <li>1 medium cucumber, julienned</li>
        <li>1 small bunch of spinach, blanched and squeezed dry</li>
        <li>4-5 pieces of pickled radish (danmuji), cut into thin strips</li>
        <li>4-5 eggs, cooked into thin omelets and cut into strips</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon (15ml) sesame oil</li>
        <li>Soy sauce or tamari, for serving</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Cooking Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Cook the rice according to package instructions. Once cooked, transfer to a large mixing bowl.</li>
        <li>In a small saucepan, combine the rice vinegar, sugar, and salt. Heat over medium heat, stirring constantly, until the sugar and salt have dissolved.</li>
        <li>Pour the vinegar mixture over the cooked rice and use a spatula to gently mix until the rice is evenly coated. Let the rice cool to room temperature.</li>
        <li>Prepare the filling ingredients: julienne the carrots and cucumber, blanch the spinach and squeeze out excess water, and cut the protein of your choice into thin strips.</li>
        <li>Place one sheet of dried seaweed on a bamboo mat (or a clean kitchen towel), with the shiny side down and the shorter edge facing you.</li>
        <li>Using wet hands, spread a thin layer of rice over the seaweed sheet, leaving about 1 inch (2.5 cm) of space at the top edge.</li>
        <li>Arrange the filling ingredients in a row across the rice, near the bottom edge of the seaweed sheet.</li>
        <li>To roll the kimbap, use the bamboo mat (or towel) to lift the bottom edge of the seaweed sheet up and over the filling, tucking it in tightly as you roll.</li>
        <li>When you reach the top edge of the seaweed sheet, dampen the edge with a bit of water to seal the kimbap closed.</li>
        <li>Use a sharp knife to slice the kimbap into bite-sized pieces.</li>
        <li>Drizzle the kimbap with sesame oil and serve with soy sauce or tamari for dipping.</li>
    </ol>
